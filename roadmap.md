Things to do:
Restructure program so that it has a single outward facing API (a SMTPServer struct)
Implement database backend for server
Remaining behavior for minimum SMTP server (VRFY, RSET)
Look into implementable SMTP extensions
An http-based API that can be used to query mail for a given address

Refactor constantly
